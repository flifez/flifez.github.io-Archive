      <description>Why? This summer the motherboard of my MacBook Pro is damaged(?) and Genius Bar replaced a new one without treasuring my data. All articles were lost. :(
I really doubt if it was damaged. It cannot be charged at first but resetting SMC controller and NVRAM would not take effect. Maybe some chips are burnt out?
What to do? You see, I am writing this article in a new website to keep my blog functioning.</description>

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-to-do&#34;&gt;What to do?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, I am writing this article in a new website to keep my blog functioning. However recovering all articles is very hard and seems to be impossible at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what&#34;&gt;So what?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you cannot see previous articles from now on.

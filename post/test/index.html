I really doubt if it was damaged. It cannot be charged at first but resetting SMC controller and NVRAM would not take effect. Maybe some chips are burnt out?

<p>This summer the motherboard of my MacBook Pro is damaged(?) and Genius Bar replaced a new one without treasuring my data. <strong>All articles were lost. :(</strong></p>
<p>I really doubt if it was damaged. It cannot be charged at first but resetting SMC controller and NVRAM would not take effect. Maybe some chips are burnt out?</p>
<h3 id="what-to-do">What to do?<a href="#what-to-do" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>You see, I am writing this article in a new website to keep my blog functioning. However recovering all articles is very hard and seems to be impossible at the time.</p>
<h3 id="so-what">So what?<a href="#so-what" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h3>
<p>So you cannot see previous articles from now on.
